          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I am a Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM), a Certified Scrum Product Owner® (CSPO), an SAP Certified NetWeaver Consultant, and former SAP Mentor in the area of Portal and Knowledge Management and Collaboration. I've been working as a technical consultant and project manager since 2002, implementing over 30 different portal and knowledge management applications worldwide. I specialize in agile management methods like Scrum and help customers improve their business by introducing agile development principles.
          </br></br>
          Among other projects, I was responsible for the design and implementation of the knowledge management platform in the SAP intranet portal (Employee Network) and I also supported the rollout of the HR Portal into ten countries at BP International PLC. For the past three years, I've been responsible for the design and implementation of SAP's biggest website (http://help.sap.com) with over 10 million pages and 500,000 hits per day, as well as the SAP internal address book replacement. Besides my responsibilities as a Product Owner, I've also acted as a consultant and trainer for other Product Owners and ScrumMasters at SAP.
          </br>  </br>
          I'm ranked among the all-time top contributors to the SAP Community Network (SCN) discussion forums "Portal" and "Knowledge Management" and was honoured for four consecutive years as a top contributor by the SAP board committee. From 2007 to 2011, I was an SAP Mentor and I am now an SAP Mentor alumni. </p>
